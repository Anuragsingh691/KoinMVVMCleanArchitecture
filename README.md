# KoinMVVMCleanArchitecture
A Basic two screen app using coroutine + retrofit + KOIN
# Overview:-
The Android app is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. It retrieves data from the Swipe public API using Retrofit for network calls. Coroutine is used for asynchronous programming and handling background tasks. Koin is used for dependency injection to manage the app's components and provide a modular architecture. The Navigation Component is used for handling navigation between different screens or fragments in the app.

# Features:-
Retrieve data from the Swipe public API.
Display data in a RecyclerView using a custom adapter.
Support dynamic URL change for the API endpoint.
Asynchronous network calls using Coroutines.
Dependency injection using Koin for modular architecture.
Handle navigation between screens or fragments using the Navigation Component.

# Prerequisites:-
Android Studio Download
Kotlin programming language
Gradle build system

# Setup:-
Clone the repository or download the project source code.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Build the project to resolve dependencies.

# Dependencies:-
The app uses the following dependencies:

Retrofit: For making network calls and interacting with the Swipe public API.
Coroutine: For handling asynchronous tasks and background operations.
Koin: For dependency injection and managing the app's components.
Navigation Component: For handling navigation between screens or fragments.
Please refer to the app's build.gradle file for the specific versions of these dependencies.

# Usage:-
Import the project into Android Studio.
Run the app on an Android device or emulator.
The app will fetch data from the Swipe public API using Retrofit and display it in the RecyclerView.
Users can switch to another server by changing the URL dynamically.
